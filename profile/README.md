# samp-crossplay (Android & PC)

**samp-crossplay** is a project developed by **Eagle Vision** with the goal of bringing the **San Andreas Multiplayer (SA-MP)** experience to both **Android** and **PC (Windows)** platforms — with crossplay support planned between them.

Our mission is to create a modern, stable, and user-friendly SA-MP client for both mobile and desktop users. The Android version already supports multiple ABI architectures (such as `armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`), ensuring compatibility with a wide range of smartphones and tablets. The PC version is currently in development, aiming to deliver the same consistent experience.

## 🎯 Goals

- Develop full-featured and optimized SA-MP clients for both Android and PC
- Provide a modern UI optimized for both touch and mouse/keyboard controls
- Ensure compatibility with public and private SA-MP servers
- Support multiple ABI architectures (Android) and stable builds (PC)
- Deliver a smooth, intuitive, and cross-platform multiplayer experience
